## This is my second attempt on making something like this, so there might be LOTS of BUGS for now, I will try to fix any problems asap!
## Many thanks to the original game https://www.pixelplush.dev/twitch.html and [streamerbot.com ](https://streamer.bot/) which I used.
## If the points scored when hitting the target are not 100% accurate with the animation position is probably because I couldn't make it consistent enough.
